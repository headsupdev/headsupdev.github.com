<li>Use XCPretty to tidy XCode build output, if installed</li>

<li>Fix issue where ordering issues by type only ordered by priority</li>
<li>Correctly parse Xcode 5 test logs</li>
<li>Fix issue where xcode build directories are not correctly cleared if using CocoaPods</li>
<li>Fix issue with maven version parsing if a version range was used</li>
<li>Fix Issue that Milestone groups do not respect filter when changed (required tracking the completed date of a group)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please report any last minute problems with this release so we can address them before 2.0 launch.</p>

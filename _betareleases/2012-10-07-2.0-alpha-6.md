<p>2.0-alpha-6 adds static code analysis for XCode projects kindly contributed by Adam Boardman</p>

<p>This is the last alpha release and should be considered a beta candidate, we do not expect
any major changes between alpha-6 and beta-1.</p>

<p>Apologies for the delay in preparing beta-1 but it will be available very soon!</p>

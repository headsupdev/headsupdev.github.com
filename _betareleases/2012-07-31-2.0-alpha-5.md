<p>2.0-alpha-5 is an interim bug fix release as we prepare beta-1.<br />
Improvements include better handling of secure mail servers, strict IRC servers and also improve stability of the overall interface.</p>

<p>We hope to have beta-1 available soon but this should improve your HeadsUp Agile installation in the meantime!</p>

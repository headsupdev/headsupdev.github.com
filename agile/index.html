<p>HeadsUp Agile is everything you ever wanted in a software project management system. It is the member of the development team you will wonder how you ever lived without. HeadsUp Agile takes care of the monotony of monitoring software health and managing teams of developers and gives your team back the time they need to do their job.</p>

<h2>Open Source</h2>
